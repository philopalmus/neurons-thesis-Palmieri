# What is this?
This is some of the code I used to explore the data and make the plots for my master thesis.
I share it here for my colleagues that use the same or a future evolution of the model in the thesis hoping it could be useful.
I also think this code could be sued as a basis to which other functions and expansions could be added, I try to make the code easy to read and understand.
